# Freelancing-Application-MERN
 The Freelancer Application is a full-stack web platform developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technology stack. It is designed to connect freelancers with clients by providing a simple and secure system to register, post, and apply for freelance jobs. The platform supports two types of users — Freelancers and Clients — and offers role-specific features to both.

This application demonstrates robust CRUD operations, secure user authentication, role-based navigation, MongoDB integration, and a clean user interface. It can be used as a real-world prototype or portfolio project showcasing full-stack development skills.
